Harry Potter has been orphaned and lives in the house of his abominable uncles and the insufferable cousin Dudley.
Harry feels very sad and alone, until one fine day he receives a letter that will change his life forever.
In it they tell him that he has been accepted as a student at Hogwarts School of Magic.
From that moment on, Harry's luck takes a spectacular turn. In this very special school he will learn enchantments, fabulous tricks and defense tactics against evil arts.
He will become the school champion of Quidditch, a kind of air football played on broomsticks, and will make a handful of good friends... but also some fearsome enemies.
But, above all, he will know the secrets that will allow him to fulfill his destiny. Well, although he may not seem like it at first glance, Harry is not an ordinary boy: he is a true wizard!
